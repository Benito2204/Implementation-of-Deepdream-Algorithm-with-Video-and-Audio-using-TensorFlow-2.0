# Implementation-of-Deepdream-Algorithm-with-Video-and-Audio-using-TensorFlow-2.0

Deepdream is a Computer Vision algorithm created by Alexander mordvintsev from Google. This algorithm works by creating trippy images.

How does Deepdream algorithm works?
1. If you feed an image to a CNN, the first layers generally detect low-level features such as edges, circles, etc...
2. As you go deeper in the network, high-level features are then detected such as faces, cars, and trees.
